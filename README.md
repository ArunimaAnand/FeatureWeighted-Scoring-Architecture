A modular ML scoring framework that combines feature-weighted regression, ensemble learning, and drift-aware calibration to produce accurate, explainable, and production-ready intelligence scores.

🚀 Overview:
  
  • Hybrid scoring using weighted regression + ensemble ML
  
  • Importance-driven feature weighting for interpretability
  
  • Drift detection & automatic score correction
  
  • On-demand retraining via modular workflows
  
  • Real-time optimized, low-latency inference pipeline
  
  • AWS SageMaker–ready deployment patterns

🔧 Key Capabilities:
  
  • End-to-end pipeline: Preprocessing → Scoring → Calibration → Inference
  
  • Config-driven architecture (config.json)
  
  • Feature engineering, lag generation & enrichment
  
  • Comparative modeling with multiple regressors & ensembles
  
  • Batch + real-time scoring modes
  
  • Reusable modules for new scoring strategies

📊 Use Cases:
  
  • Performance/health scoring
  
  • Risk or anomaly scoring

  • Intelligent ranking/decisioning

  • Multi-signal ML assessment pipelines
